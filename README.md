**How to Run This Project**
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Git**: To clone the repository.
  - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

- **A web browser** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to view the project.
Steps to Run Locally
1. **Clone the repository**:
   First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```
   Replace the URL with the URL of your repository.

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. **Open the project in a browser**:
   This project is a simple static web page, so you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser:
   - Double-click `index.html` file or open it directly in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html   # For macOS
   start index.html  # For Windows
   xdg-open index.html  # For Linux
   ```

   Alternatively, you can serve the project locally using a local server for a better experience, especially if you are working with dynamic content or JavaScript frameworks.

4. **(Optional) Run a Local Development Server**:
   If you want to serve the page through a local server (helpful for testing or development):
   - **Using Python (Python 3.x)**:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
     This will start a local server at `http://localhost:8000`, where you can view the project.

   - **Using VSCode**: If you have VSCode, you can use its Live Server extension to open the project with live reload:
     - Install the **Live Server** extension in VSCode.
     - Right-click on the `index.html` file and select **Open with Live Server**.

5. **Make Changes and Commit**:
   - If you want to contribute or make changes to the project:
     1. Edit the files as needed.
     2. Stage the changes:
        ```bash
        git add .
        ```
     3. Commit the changes:
        ```bash
        git commit -m "Your commit message"
        ```
     4. Push the changes:
        ```bash
        git push origin main
        ```
